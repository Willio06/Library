# README for Crypto Tools and CTF Solutions

## Overview

This repository contains two main types of resources: 
1. **TIBASIC scripts** designed for performing cryptographic operations on TI calculators.
2. **Python scripts** that provide solutions for various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, focusing on cryptography.

- Functions include:
  - Baby Step Giant Step
  - Chinese Remainder
  - Prime test
  - Prime factorization
  - Modular Inverse
  - Repeated Exponentiation
### 2. **Python Files**

## Usage

### TIBASIC Scripts
1. Transfer the `.8xp` files to your TI calculator using the [TI Connect CE software](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-software-suite).
2. Run the scripts directly on your calculator for cryptographic operations.

### Python Files
1. Install Python3
